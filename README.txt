Builder's note:
1. I initialized this R package using package "devtools".
2. I added DPw package as dependency in DESCRIPTION.
3. I splited the different functions from astmTL.R and astmME.R into separate functions.
4. The documentations I used for the functions in 3 are copied from the comments for the functions.
5. I started a Vignettes file which could be edited later to include the Shiny app.

Things could be done:
1. Add other methods
2. Update documentations(i.e. name of tl method)
3. Add examples
4. Add tests
5. Update DESCRIPTION
6. Update Vignettes


# Test package (devtools::test()) runs the tests.
# Check (devtools::check()) runs the tests (also updates vignette, documentation, etc).
